# Media Browser

The media browser in this repo is designed in support of a local media library, primarily relying on a local database maintained by code in the media_suite repo. Although it can work with local directories directly, its main use is through the database, and therefore is likely to be of limited use outside that context. But if any of the code here is helpful to you, I'm glad!

This browser depends on the textual library from Textualize: https://github.com/Textualize/textual
among others. Thanks to all who provide open source libraries!
